# walcut
**Cut line 17 from pywal dwm**

*If you are not using the urgent colors patch for dwm, you have to manually remove line 17 of the generated 'colors-wal-dwm.h' each time you run 'wal'. This program will do that automatically for you. Just download the binary and run 'exec walcut' or place in your ~/bin and $PATH to call it from anywhere using 'walcut'.*
